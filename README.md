Project #1 Cluster Stability

In this project, I compute cluster stability, which is a measure of how similar a clustering on a big data set is to clusterings on subsets of that data set. For example, if a data set of 100,000 nodes yields 10 clusters, would a subset of 1,000 of the nodes yield the same cluster? This is one way to measure how robust a clustering is, and I have implemented it with a simple example in Cluster_stability.ipynb.
